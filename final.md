## B-Tree

_Properties_

- if there is $n$ keys in the node, there is $n+1$ children
- keys and children are sorted
- All leaves have the same depth, which is the treeâ€™s height $h$.
- a B-tree has a _minimum degree_ $t$, where $t-1 \leq n \leq 2t-1$
  - if $t = 2$, then $1 \leq n \leq 3$

## Definitions

Let $G = (V, E)$ denote a graph,
where $V$ is the set of vertices and $E$ is the set of edges.

**Defn**
$G$ is _sparse_ if $|E| << |V|^2$.

_dense_?

**Defn**
$G$ is _sparse_ if $|E| << |V|^2$.

**Defn**
$G$ is _dense_ if $|E| \approx |V|^2$.

**Defn**
$G$ is connected if for all $v \in V$,
there is $(v, \_) \in E$.
There is a path from any vertex to any other vertex.

## Representation of Graph

adjacency list

```hs
type Neighbor = [Node]
map<Node, Neighbor>
```

adjacency matrix $A$

<!-- ```hs
type E = Edges
A i j =
  | (i, j) in E = 1
  | otherwise   = 0
``` -->

$$
a_{ij} = \begin{cases}
  1 \quad \text{if } (i, j) \in E \\
  0 \quad \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

### Pros & Cons?

Comparing Adj List and Adj Matrix

---

### Pros & Cons?

what are some advantages/disadvantages of using a adj list?

- +: easier weights on edges
- -: $hasEdge: G \rightarrow Bool$ time complexity

what are some advantages/disadvantages of using a adj matrix?

- +: if undirected, $A$ must be symmetric
- +: faster computation (matrix algebra easier parallelized)
- +: $O(1)$ for $hasEdge$
- -: needs more memory

# Minimum Spanning Tree

Let graph $G = (V, E)$ be weighted.
That is, for all $e \in E$,
there is $w_e \in \mathbb{R}$.

We want to find a subset $T \subseteq E$
such that,

$$
\min \quad \sum_{e \in T} w_e
$$

subject to

1. each $v \in V$ is connected to at least some edge $(\_, v)$ or $(v, \_) \in T$.
2. $T$ is connected and acyclic, $|T| = |V| - 1$.
